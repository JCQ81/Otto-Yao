# Otto Yao (Yet Another One)

Another version of the "famous" Otto DIY dancing robot, inspired by the existing movies on YouTube, but rebuild from scratch just because I liked doing it :). It runs on an Arduino Pro Mini board powered by two AAA batteries. Here you can get / download all information to rebuild it. This is not the best one around, so if you're looking for something better please do so!

#### Requirements:
* 1x Arduino Pro Mini ATMega 328p 5V
* 1x BC337 transistor
* 1x 100µF Capacitor *(*1)*
* 1x 1V-5V to 5V DC-DC Step-Up Power booster
* 4x Servo SG90 180 degrees
* 1x Power Switch
* 1x Battery case - 2slot AAA
* 1x Prototype PCB (not required, but very useful)
* Power cables (red&black)
* Programming board for the Arduino Pro Mini *(*2)*
* Soldering station
* 3D Printer
* Glue

**1: This value is just a guess, also tried a 1000µF wich worked fine, but drained the batteries in no-time*

**2: There are several solutions, like using another arduino with an USB interface like the R3 or Nano, or use an interface like the CP2102 wich I preferred (don't forget to also order your dupont cables)*

#### 3D models:
The STL's for printing the casing are available in the submap *models-3d*, where you also can find the source files (FCStd - FreeCad)
